# Phonetic Russian Keyboard for Windows
A phonetic Russian keyboard for Windows that doesn't suck

## What?
This project takes the phonetic Russian keyboard layouts from Ubuntu and OSX, and makes them available on Windows. They have been tested on Windows 10, but should presumably work on Windows 7 as well.

## Why?
A phonetic Russian keyboard is useful for people for people who are new to typing in Russian, don't have a keyboard with Russian characters on it, or (like myself) never bothered to learn the proper Russian keyboard layout.

The phonetic Russian keyboard in Windows 10, called **Russian Mnemonic** is pretty terrible. Instead of mapping each key to one letter, it has you type combination of keys to produce one Russian letter. For example **ё** is **y-o**, **я** is **y-a**, but **ы** is y followed by anything other than **o** or **a**. As you can imagine, typing **ыo** is... inconvenient. The same goes for several other letters.

The phonetic Russian keyboards in Ubuntu and OSX are much more reasonable in that they map each letter to one keyboard key.

## Where?
You can download the latest keyboard layouts in the [Releases](https://github.com/epoblaguev/russian-phonetic-keyboard/releases) section, or compile them yourself using [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339) and the **.klc** files in this repository.

## How?
Detailed instructions for installing or building the keyboards will be added here at a later time...
