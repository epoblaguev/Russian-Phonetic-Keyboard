# Phonetic Russian Keyboards for Windows

## What?
This project takes the phonetic Russian keyboard layouts from Ubuntu and OSX, and makes them available on Windows. They have been tested on Windows 10, but should presumably work on Windows 7 as well.

## Why?
A phonetic Russian keyboard is useful for people who are new to typing in Russian, don't have a keyboard with Russian characters on it, or (like myself) never bothered to learn the proper Russian keyboard layout.

The phonetic Russian keyboard layout that comes with Windows 10, called **Russian Mnemonic**, isn't great. Instead of mapping each key to one letter, it has you type combinations of keys to produce one Russian letter. For example **ё** is **y-o**, **я** is **y-a**, but **ы** is **y** followed by anything other than **o** or **a**. As you can imagine, typing **ыo** is... inconvenient. The same goes for several other letters.

The phonetic Russian keyboards in Ubuntu and OSX are much more reasonable in that they map each letter to one keyboard key.

## Where and How?
You can download the latest keyboard layouts in the [Releases](https://github.com/epoblaguev/russian-phonetic-keyboard/releases) section, or compile them yourself using [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339) and the **.klc** files in this repository.

After installing the keyboard, reboot your computer and it should appear in the **Language Settings** section under **Russian**.

## What are the layouts?
All layouts have four states - regular, holding **Shift**, holding **Ctrl+Alt**, and holding **Ctrl+Alt+Shift**. 

Holding **Ctrl+Alt** allows you to use characters from the English layout that were replaced in the Russian layout. For example, in the OSX keyboard you can hold **Ctrl+Alt** to type **-** and **=** instead of **ь** and **ъ**. In the same vein, holding **Ctrl+Alt+Shift** allows you to type **_** and **+**.

Instead of holding **Ctrl+Alt**, you can also get the same effect by holding the **Right Alt** key.

Screenshots of all the layouts are below:
